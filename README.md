# Zoo Management 

This is a small project of Lab221. I created an manager for managing animals in zoo.

There are four type of animals in the zoo:
 - Animals with four legs: Lion, Tiger,...
 - Animals can fly: Flamingo, Eagle,...
 - Animals cannot fly: Monkey, Penguin,...
 - Animal zero leg: Cobra, Viper,...

 - 1.Load data from file. This file contain information of animals in the zoo
 - 2.Add new animal steps:
   + Step 1: Choose animal type
   + Step 2: Enter info mation of animal (weight, food,...)
 - 3.Update animal:
   + Step 1: Search animal ID, the program will return to the main menu if the ID not exist.
   + Step 2: Choose information you want to change
 - 4.Search animal:
   + Step 1: Search animal ID, the program will return to the main menu if the ID not exist.
   + Step 2: Press Yes/No to determine delete or not.
